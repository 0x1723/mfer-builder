**Seed**

mfers are generated using a 28 length "seed" of numbers expressed as a string ('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx') in the following order:

xx: background

xx: type

xx: eyes

xx: mouth

xx: headphones

xx: smoke

xx: watch

xx: beard

xx: hoodies

xx: shirt

xx: longHair

xx: hatsUnder

xx: hatsOver

xx: shortHair


All traits are expressed using the following convention:

None: -1
Random: 00
Trait n: n
Trait n + 1: n + 1

For Example:

0000000000000000000000000000 would mean all mfers traits are selected at random
-100000000000000000000000000 would mean there was no background
